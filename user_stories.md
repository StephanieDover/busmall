As the Marketing team I want...  

1) an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups  

2) I want the app to display three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side  

3) to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest  

4) The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.   

5) To have an effective analysis, only display the data after a total of 25 clicks.

As the focus group participant...

1) I want the app to be easy to use.

2) I want it to switch between images quickly after each click.

3) I want the app to be visually appealing.  

4) I want it to work with minimum effort so I can focus only on choosing the product images.  

As the Developer...

1) I want a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image.  

2) I will create an event listener and handler to count the number of clicks on each image and the number of times the image is displayed.

3) I will make a loop to show the images.

4) I want to display the results on the document after 25 click events.  

5) I will create the look and feel of the app, with custom font, color palette, and layout with semantic HTML
